Note these are NeuroML 2 files automatically generated (by neuroConstruct) from the source project in ../neuroConstruct

These are included here to test the mapping of NeuroML v1.x files to NeuroML 2, and will be updated from the source files as the mapping improves

*.nml files are "pure" NeuroML 2 files
*.xml files are LEMS files which can be used to execute the model using the nml2 utility, see http://www.neuroml.org/neuroml2.php#libNeuroML
